    "> WORKING WITH SENSITIVE DATA : \n",
    "It is possible to work with sensitive data, e.g. data from your employer. In this case, we first recommend you to anonymize your dataset. For example, you can change the label name of your features or rescale the values before sharing. This step should already take care of most concerns around sensitive data. As a second alternative, you could also prepare a small example dataset (which you manipulate in such a way that itâ€™s not sensitive anymore) that showcases the structure and general information of your dataset."
