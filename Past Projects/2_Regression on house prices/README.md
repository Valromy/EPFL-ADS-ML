# House Prices Prediction Project

## Overview
- Work on the house prices dataset with 2,930 observations and 82 attributes
- Go through all main steps of a data science project (preparing data, EDA, and modeling)
- Use the first 2,430 observations for training and the last 500 for testing

## Tasks

1. Data Cleaning
   - Find and handle incorrect and missing values
   - Correct inconsistencies in the variables
   - Handle outliers

2. Feature Engineering
   - Create indicator variables
   - Apply transformations

3. Feature Encoding
   - Encode ordinal and nominal variables

4. Splitting Data
   - Split data into training and validation sets (e.g. 60-40 split)

5. Model Fitting
   - Fit a baseline, a simple model, an intermediate model, and a complex model

6. Evaluation Metrics
   - Track different metrics and report the MAE score in dollars for each model

7. Regularization
   - Apply regularization to the complex model
   - Tune regularization strength with grid search
   - Plot the training and validation curves

8. Communicating the Results
   - Provide a final visualization summarizing the different models' MAE scores

9. Predicting on Test Data
   - Predict house prices for the test set using each model
   - Save predictions in separate .csv files
